Hii Friends,

I am Harshkumar Patel. I have cpompleted my four year graduation in the field of Information and Technology. After that I took 6 months of experience as a Junior Node.js developer in India. Currently, I am pursuing my Post Graduation degree in Web Development from Conestoga College, Which is very famous in Canada to educating I.T field related subjects.

I have a knowledge about Html,Css and Javascript for the frontend side. I completed projects in Django and Node.js framwork with the use of MongoDb and SQL database. I have knowledge about C, Python, Javascript, Java, Sql and Mongodb.
Right now, I am exploring my knowledge in Front-end as well as Back-end, because I think that to become a Full-stack developer it is very important. Every field's little bit knowledge is essential to become a Software Developer.

Thanks,
Harsh Patel.
